# Object Counting and Upload to SharePoint

This project involves capturing video from a webcam, detecting objects, counting the number of objects detected, and uploading the results to SharePoint.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyYAML
- openpyxl
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-counting-sharepoint.git
   cd object-counting-sharepoint
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pyyaml openpyxl requests
   ```
3. Set up your Azure AD application and SharePoint site to get the necessary credentials:

   - **Azure AD Application Registration**

     - Register a new application in Azure AD.
     - Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.
     - Create a client secret for the application.
     - Grant the application the necessary permissions to access SharePoint (e.g., `Files.ReadWrite.All`).
   - **SharePoint Site and Drive Information**

     - Obtain your SharePoint site ID and drive ID where you want to upload the Excel files.

## Configuration

Update the script with your Azure AD and SharePoint credentials:

1. **Azure AD Credentials**

   ```python
   tenant_id = 'your-tenant-id'
   client_id = 'your-client-id'
   client_secret = 'your-client-secret'
   ```
2. **SharePoint Site and Drive Information**

   ```python
   site_id = 'your-site-id'
   drive_id = 'your-drive-id'
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the YAML configuration file**

   Ensure your `../datasets/area.yml` file is correctly formatted to define the object areas.
2. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python object_counting_sharepoint.py
   ```

   The script will:

   - Capture video from the webcam.
   - Detect and count objects based on the defined areas in the YAML file.
   - Display the counting results on the video feed.
   - Save the counting results to an Excel file.
   - Upload the Excel file to the specified SharePoint site.

## Code Explanation

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Initialization**

   - Initializes variables for counting and tracking object detections.
   - Prepares an Excel workbook for recording results.
2. **Configuration**

   - Reads the object area definitions from a YAML file.
3. **Video Capture and Processing**

   - Captures video frames from the webcam.
   - Processes each frame to detect objects based on defined areas.
   - Updates the counting results and overlays information on the video frame.
4. **Excel File Management**

   - Records the counting results in an Excel file.
5. **SharePoint Upload**

   - Uses the Microsoft Graph API to upload the Excel file to SharePoint.

## Notes

- Make sure the webcam is properly connected and accessible by OpenCV.
- Ensure the YAML configuration file correctly defines the areas for object detection.
